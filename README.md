# Mini-Data-Analysis-Haley-MacDonald
Repository for Haley MacDonald's Mini Data Analysis 


Files included in this repository:

mini-data-analysis.Rmd: this file was provided by the STAT545 instructors as a template for our mini-data analysis. I have updated it with R code and comments that fulfill all of the tasks laid out in the original document. I formatted the document with R markdown formatting so it would appear in a way that makes sense when knitted into an html file

mini-data-analysis.md: this file was created when the similarly titled .Rmd file (described above) was 'knit' into a github_document
