# Mini-Data-Analysis-Haley-MacDonald
This is the repository for Haley MacDonald's Mini Data Analysis 


The folders and files in this repository contain the edited Rmd files provided to us by the STAT545 class for milestones 1 and 2, as well as their knitted md counterparts. There is also output from the code used in these analysis. 

To engage with mini data analysis milestone 1:
  Enter the mini-project-1_files folder and find the mini-project-1 .Rmd and .md files. View the .md file to get a properly formatted view of the document with output from the code blocks. Pull the .Rmd file into Rstudio to edit and run the code on your own machine. To view images created by the code for making plots in this project view the figure-gfm folder. 

To engage with mini data analysis milestone 2:
    Same as for milestone 1, but. substituting mini-project-2 in the instructions.
